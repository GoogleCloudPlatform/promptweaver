    # Task
    You are an AI model trained to classify contact center call transcriptions into one of the following six categories: "solved ", "unsolved", "partially solved", "transferred", "out of scope" or "unclear".

    ## Instructions
    1. **Analyze the entire transcription carefully.** Pay attention to the dialogue between the two speakers (Speaker A and Speaker B), focusing on the inquiry or issue presented, the responses provided, and the overall outcome of the interaction.
    2. **Identify the primary inquiry or issue** presented during the call.
    3. **Infer the roles of the speakers.**  Based on the context of the conversation, try to deduce which speaker is likely the customer and which is likely the agent.
    4. **Assess the resolution status of the primary inquiry or issue.** 
    5. **Reflect on the evidence:** Summarize the key points in the transcription that support your assessment of the resolution status. Consider the following:
      - **Statements from both speakers:** Did either speaker express satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the outcome?
      - **Actions taken:** Did one speaker provide a solution, suggest a transfer, or indicate the issue is out of scope?
      - **Overall tone and sentiment:** What is the overall tone of the conversation, and does it suggest resolution or lack thereof?
    6. **Classify the transcription based on the following criteria**:
      - **solved**: The customer's inquiry or issue was fully and satisfactorily addressed during the call.
      - **unsolved**: The customer's inquiry or issue remains unresolved at the end of the call.
      - **partially solved**: Some aspects of the customer's inquiry or issue were addressed, but not fully resolved. 
      - **transferred**: The call was transferred to another department, agent, or specialized team for further assistance.
      - **out of scope**: The customer's inquiry or issue falls outside the scope of the contact center's services or expertise.
      - **unclear**: The transcription is ambiguous or lacks sufficient information to make a confident classification
    
    ## Model Output
    **Output the result in JSON format** with two fields:
    - **"evidences"**: A concise summary of the key points in the transcription that support your classification
    - **"classification"**: The predicted classification for the transcription (one of the six categories)
    
    ## Example
    ### Contact Center Transcription
    Speaker A: "Hi, I'm having trouble logging into my account. I keep getting an error message."
    Speaker B: "Okay, let's try resetting your password. Can you provide me with your email address?"
    Speaker A: "Sure, it's johnsmith@email.com"
    Speaker B: "Great. I've sent you a password reset link. Please check your inbox and follow the instructions."
    Speaker A: "I got it. Thanks, I was able to log in now."
    Speaker B: "You're welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
    Speaker A: "No, that's all. Thank you for your help!"

    ### Output
    ```json
    {
      "evidences": "evidences": "Speaker A reported an issue with logging in. Speaker B provided a solution (password reset), and Speaker A confirmed they were able to log in successfully. Speaker A expressed gratitude, and no further issues were raised."
      "classification": "solved"
    }
    ```
    
    ## Additional Instructions
    Prioritize accuracy and provide clear evidence reflections before your classifications.
    If the transcription is ambiguous or lacks sufficient information to make a confident classification, state that it is "unclear" and explain why in the evidences field.

      Speaker A: "I'm calling about my recent order. It hasn't arrived yet, and it was supposed to be delivered three days ago."
      Speaker B: "I apologize for the delay. Let me check the tracking information for you. Can I have your order number?"
      Speaker A: "Sure, it's 123456."
      Speaker B: "Thank you. It looks like your package is still in transit. Unfortunately, there's been a slight delay due to unforeseen circumstances. We expect it to be delivered within the next two business days."
      Speaker A: "Two more days? That's unacceptable. I needed this item for an event tomorrow. Is there any way to expedite the delivery?"
      Speaker B: "I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee expedited delivery at this point. However, I'll make a note on your order and see if there's anything we can do to speed things up. I'll also keep you updated on any changes."
      Speaker A: "Okay, I appreciate that. But I'm still very disappointed. I'll have to find an alternative solution for tomorrow's event."
      Speaker B: "Again, I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll do our best to get your order to you as soon as possible."
